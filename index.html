  <p>It’s Christmas Day. You’re floating serenely in the coral sea surrounding a real live tropical desert island…when, suddenly, you’re having a too-close encounter with deadly wildlife. What do you do? Just follow your Incident Response Plan, of course!†</p>
<p>Don’t have an Incident Response Plan? No worries. I’ll take you through how to make a plan to help you navigate the shark-infested waters of a security incident with less stress, and get back to business - or living your best tropical mermaid life - quicker.</p>
<p>If your team’s worst-case scenario plan is to hope it never happens, this talk is for you. I’ll show you why you should prepare for the worst, and how anyone can make a plan that works.</p>
