  <p>It’s Christmas Day. You’re floating serenely in the coral sea surrounding a real live tropical desert island…when, suddenly, you’re having a too-close encounter with deadly wildlife. What do you do? Just follow your Incident Response Plan, of course!†</p>
<p>Don’t have an Incident Response Plan? No worries. I’ll take you through how to make a plan to help you navigate the shark-infested waters of a security incident with less stress, and get back to business - or living your best tropical mermaid life - quicker.</p>
<p>If your team’s worst-case scenario plan is to hope it never happens, this talk is for you. I’ll show you why you should prepare for the worst, and how anyone can make a plan that works.</p>

  <p>Red teamers and blue teamers share a common goal: to protect people from security threats. But we aren’t doing a great job – security breaches increase in number every year, and most of them still start with someone falling for a phishing scam. Why? Because the way we teach people to spot a scam is so totally, utterly, job-security-guaranteeingly broken it sets them up to fail.</p>
<p>Comrades, it’s time to put aside our differences and unite to destroy our common enemy: corporate security awareness programmes that teach people that a legitimate company would never do things that legitimate companies do every day. Let’s talk about how they do more harm than good, and what we can do to make security awareness suck less for everyone.</p>
